### Updated list (always run first to verify the IDs
GET http://localhost:4000/vehicles

### Forbidden delete (id=2 is InUse) → expected 422 DELETE_FORBIDDEN
DELETE http://localhost:4000/vehicles/2

### Allowed delete (id=4 is Available) → expected 200
DELETE http://localhost:4000/vehicles/4

### Valid status change (id=3 from InUse → Available) → expected 200
PATCH http://localhost:4000/vehicles/3/status
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "Available"
}

### Invalid status change (Changing id=3 from Available → InUse is actually valid, so to test a forbidden transition we will use Maintenance → InUse)
# Try changing it to Maintenance first — you may get 422 MAINT_CAP (5%) because the total number of vehicles is small. This is normal. 
PATCH http://localhost:4000/vehicles/3/status
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "Maintenance"
}

### If the change to Maintenance succeeded, now test the forbidden transition:
Maintenance → InUse → expected 422 ILLEGAL_TRANSITION 
PATCH http://localhost:4000/vehicles/3/status
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "InUse"
}

  "license_plate": "55-666-77",

### 6) Another valid vehicle creation (for testing)
